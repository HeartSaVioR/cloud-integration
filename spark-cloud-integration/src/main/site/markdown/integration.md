# Integrating the Apache Hadoop S3A Committers with Apache Spark

This document looks at the whole issue of "how to integrate the Hadoop S3A Committers" 
with Apache Spark â€”it is intended to apply to any custom `PathOutputCommitter`
implementation.


## Background: Hadoop

Hadoop has two MapReduce APIs, MRv1 and MRv2 (not to be distnguished from the v1/v2 commit
algorithms.) MRv1 classes are found under the packages `org.apache.hadoop.mapred`;
the MRv2 classes under `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce`. This is important, as
they often share classnames.



The "original" V1 API shipped in Hadoop 1. The newer v2 API came in Hadoop 2. 
In Spark's `RDD.saveAsTextFile()` uses the MRv2 APIs to write data.
